Algorithm
========

Install
-------

Just run the install.py script. This should:
* Get all the dependencies using bower
* Copy all the dependencies from bower_components into src/lib
* Run an initial SConstruct command

If you are not changing the C++ code, you should be good to go


Build
-----

run scons in the algorithm folder

The main artifact is going to be in the ./build folder

Testing

TODO
